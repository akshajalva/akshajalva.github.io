          Feeling confined to a desk left me craving a more dynamic lifestyle. What started as volunteering for sports events such as surfing, triathlons, marathons, ocean swimming, beach festivals and other sports competitions soon made me a part of the sports community. I realised I enjoy pushing my limits, I started running and documented about it on my blog <a href="https://thewannabeathlete9.wordpress.com/"> <b><i>'The Wannabe Athlete'</i></b></a>
          with utmost enthusiasm. Although the blog is inactive now, I still run, <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/akshajalva"><b><i>Strava</i></b></a> is my witness. I didn't think I would, but I did manage to complete a full marathon. Now I dream of finishing the Ironman someday! 
          I love playing and watching Football. Cricket goes without saying. And jiujitsu is just a form of art. <br>
          My mother says I have a green thumb - I do have an appreciation for agriculture and make some visits to the farm fields with my dad. 
          All in all, my elder sister thinks I'm a cool guy to have in a team, if I were you, I would take her word for it.

      <div class="box">
        <p>
          In the final year of my work at Accenture, I realized that my interests lay in a different field—specifically, the sports industry. I wanted to leverage the skills and experience I had from working in events during my college days to events that resonated with my passions. To explore this interest, I took a career break and actively pursued opportunities in the sports industry.
          
          During this time, I volunteered at various local sports events, such as surfing competitions, triathlons, marathons, ocean swimming events, and beach festivals. I gained hands-on experience in organizing and managing these events. Additionally, I networked extensively, gave multiple interviews, and even cleared the FIFA Agent exam to better understand the sports industry landscape.
          
          While I was intrigued by the sports industry, I recognized its volatility and decided to focus on data science. Since April 2024, I have been developing my data science skills through self-learning and courses, focusing on programming fundamentals, machine learning, and project-building. Over time, I have progressed to learning deep learning techniques and building meaningful projects in NLP.
